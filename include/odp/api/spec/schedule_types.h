/**
 * @def ODP_SCHED_SYNC_PARALLEL
 * Parallel scheduled queues
 *
 * The scheduler performs priority scheduling, load balancing, prefetching, etc
 * functions but does not provide additional event synchronization or ordering.
 * It's free to schedule events from single parallel queue to multiple threads
 * for concurrent processing. Application is responsible for queue context
 * synchronization and event ordering (SW synchronization).
 */

/**
 * @def ODP_SCHED_SYNC_ATOMIC
 * Atomic queue synchronization
 *
 * Events from an atomic queue can be scheduled only to a single thread at a
 * time. The thread is guaranteed to have exclusive (atomic) access to the
 * associated queue context, which enables the user to avoid SW synchronization.
 * Atomic queue also helps to maintain event ordering since only one thread at
 * a time is able to process events from a queue.
 *
 * The atomic queue synchronization context is dedicated to the thread until it
 * requests another event from the scheduler, which implicitly releases the
 * context. User may allow the scheduler to release the context earlier than
 * that by calling odp_schedule_release_atomic(). However, this call is just
 * a hint to the implementation and the context may be held until the next
 * schedule call.
 *
 * When scheduler is enabled as flow-aware, the event flow id value affects
 * scheduling of the event and synchronization is maintained per flow within
 * each queue.
 */

/**
 * @def ODP_SCHED_SYNC_ORDERED
 * Ordered queue synchronization
 *
 * Events from an ordered queue can be scheduled to multiple threads for
 * concurrent processing but still maintain the original event order. This
 * enables the user to achieve high single flow throughput by avoiding
 * SW synchronization for ordering between threads.
 *
 * The source queue (dequeue) ordering is maintained when
 * events are enqueued to their destination queue(s) within the same ordered
 * queue synchronization context. A thread holds the context until it
 * requests another event from the scheduler, which implicitly releases the
 * context. User may allow the scheduler to release the context earlier than
 * that by calling odp_schedule_release_ordered(). However, this call is just
 * a hint to the implementation and the context may be held until the next
 * schedule call.
 *
 * Events from the same (source) queue appear in their original order
 * when dequeued from a destination queue. The destination queue can have any
 * queue type and synchronization method. Event ordering is based on the
 * received event(s), but also other (newly allocated or stored) events are
 * ordered when enqueued within the same ordered context. Events not enqueued
 * (e.g. freed or stored) within the context are considered missing from
 * reordering and are skipped at this time (but can be ordered again within
 * another context).
 *
 * Unnecessary event re-ordering may be avoided for those destination queues
 * that do not need to maintain the original event order by setting 'order'
 * queue parameter to ODP_QUEUE_ORDER_IGNORE.
 *
 * When scheduler is enabled as flow-aware, the event flow id value affects
 * scheduling of the event and synchronization is maintained per flow within
 * each queue.
